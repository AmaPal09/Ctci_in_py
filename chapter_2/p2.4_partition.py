# Partition
# Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that
# all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal
# to x. (IMPORTANT: The partition element x can appera anywhere in
# the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left
# and right partitions. The additional spacing in the example below
# indicates the partition. Yes, the output below is one of many value
# outputs!)
